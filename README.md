# Number-Guessing-Game
A Java console game where the player guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within limited attempts. It demonstrates core Java concepts like input handling, loops, conditionals, and error checking in a clean, user-friendly format.

# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game (Java)

A quick and fun console-based game built in Java as part of my internship at Codveda Technologies. This project demonstrates basic programming concepts including:

- Random number generation
- User input handling
- Looping and conditionals
- Input validation and error handling
- Clean class structure and maintainable code

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

- The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The user has 7 attempts to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, the program provides feedback:
  - "Too high"
  - "Too low"
  - "Correct!"
- Invalid inputs are handled gracefully.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Java SE
- Scanner for input
- Random class for number generation
- Console-based UI

## ðŸ“¦ Folder Structure
